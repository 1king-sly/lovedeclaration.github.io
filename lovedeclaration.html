           <P style="font-family:monotype corsiva;"><pre>
            Beautiful eyes and magnificent figure
            Just like chicken fries my emotions you trigger
            You make my temperature rise and urge grows bigger
            Will chase all the guys for love I am the jaguar

            Won’t feed you love with a spoon, I prefer the shovel
            Night can’t resist the moon and m heart your love can’t repel
            It might be soon to say in your love I have fell
            Only you made a goon feel something he can’t tell

            Let me give you a caution for you might not turn back
            I don’t use a love portion but where I pass I live a mark
            When seeing me becomes an addiction know you are on the right track
            For love is an Ocean and I am the only shark

            When I think of you I stare the photograph
            Memories are stuck like glue when I see you laugh
            Couples look at me and you for we rise beyond their graph
            Your heart I want to subdue and make you my better half
